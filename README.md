# Practical Python: Data Wrangling and Data Quality

This repo contains draft coding exercises for the early-release version of the book _Practical Python: Data Wrangling and Data Quality_ to be published by O'Reilly Media in 2021.

## Before You Begin

Below you will find an overview of this repo's contents, as well as important tips and information on how to use these files. In general, all exercises are accessible as standalone `.py` files, and as Jupyter Notebooks. The notebooks can either be downloaded to your device and run locally, or opened and run in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/). The draft text of Chapter 1 includes basic instructions on how to get started with some of these tools; this text will be updated/completed before final publication.

### Working with data files

Because data sets can often be quite large, the data sets for these exercises are available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q_dkJxfsCjeZjWH3Hs2WKWYFSTa7MsBn?usp=sharing). 

#### If you are working locally
Data sets should be downloaded/copied in the same folder as the Python file or notebook, unless otherwise indicated.
