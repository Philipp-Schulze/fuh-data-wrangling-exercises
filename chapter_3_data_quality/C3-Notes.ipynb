    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* validity:             measuring the right things.\n",
    "* reliability:          measurements are consistent if repeated.\n",

    "## Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is usable throughout its lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "* known provenance:         origin and history of data are known\n",
    "* well annotated:           meta data is usable, data dictionary\n",
    "* timely:                   data is new enough\n",
    "* complete:                 missing values\n",
    "* high volume:              enough data points for reliable analysis\n",
    "* atomic:                   data stored in smallest unit possible, no aggregations\n",
    "* consistent:               no change over time or systems\n",
    "* clear:                    well defined data, format understandable\n",
    "* dimension structured:     data organized over appropiate dimensions, allowing slicing (yymdd)\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "* handling NaNs:            remove or impute\n",
    "* outliers:                 remove or adjust\n",
    "* data types:               convert columns (datetime, string, int)\n",
    "* duplicates:               remove\n",
    "* standardize:              date, units etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "expand the dataset, to get more insights, make data more robust\n",
